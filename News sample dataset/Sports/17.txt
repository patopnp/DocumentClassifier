Tony Bellew and David Haye have agreed terms for a heavyweight rematch on Sunday 17 December.
Bellew stepped up to heavyweight to beat Haye in London in March but the fact Haye fought for five of their 11 rounds with a ruptured achilles left more questions than answers.

There was plenty of bad blood between the pair in the buildup to the first fight and now, with Haye fit again, the pair will have a rematch at the O2 Arena. It is believed the London venue was not available on a suitable Saturday.
“I will have the exact same attitude I had going into the first fight – win at all costs,” said Bellew. “I will be victorious on 17 December and I will end David Haye’s career. Another loss to me closes the curtain on the Hayemaker. This isn’t personal anymore, it’s strictly business. This is just another fight.”
Haye – the heavyweight champion between 2009-11 – has rebuilt both his body and his team since the loss to Bellew, with Ismael Salas taking over from Shane McGuigan as his trainer.
He said: “I’m excited to give the public the rematch they truly crave, ever since the explosive first showdown earlier this year. On 4 March the script was thrown out the window and the unpredictability of sport revealed itself in its most raw form. He somehow won the lottery in our first fight but believe me, he won’t win the lottery twice.
“I’ve been training every day for over six months. I already feel fitter, stronger and more athletic than I did for our first showdown. On 17 December, I will relish the opportunity to rewrite the ending of the Haye-Bellew story.”
