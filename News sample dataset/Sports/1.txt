San Jose Sharks rookie Macklin Celebrini on injured list after scoring in debut

San Jose Sharks center Macklin Celebrini, the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NHL draft, was placed on injured reserve Saturday with a lower-body injury.

Celebrini had been dealing with a lower-body injury during training camp and the preseason. Coach Ryan Warsofsky didn't provide additional comment on the circumstances after Celebrini didn't participate in Friday's practice.

Celebrini, 18, made history in his NHL debut, scoring a goal and an assist in the Sharks' 5-4 overtime loss at home to the St. Louis Blues on Thursday.

The goal came 7:01 into the game, when he tried a pass from the right circle to teammate William Eklund in the slot. The puck deflected off Blues defenseman Matt Kessel's leg and went past goaltender Joel Hofer.

It was the second-fastest goal for a No. 1 pick in his debut, bested only by Mario Lemieux's score 2:59 into his first game for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
