Vince Carter was an NBA star.

An eight-time All-Star. Two-time All-NBA. 1998-99 Rookie of the Year. One of the 25 players who have scored at least 25,000 points in the NBA. 2000 Slam Dunk contest champ. Olympic gold medalist at the 2000 Sydney Summer Games. 2015-16 Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year. 2019-20 Sportsmanship Award.

Yes, he was a magnificent dunker – the dunk contest win and memorable slam over France’s Frederic Weis at the Olympics, known as the Dunk of Death, are evidence – but he also had game outside of that. He was a rebounder, passer and quality shooter.

His impact on basketball extended far beyond statistics and dunks.

He influenced a country that resonates today. Acquired by the Toronto Raptors as the No. 5 pick in the 1998 NBA draft, Carter helped turn Canada into a nation that produced multiple elite basketball players, a feat that seemed almost impossible three decades ago.

Carter is among the 13 players, coaches, contributors and executives who will be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame on Sunday.
