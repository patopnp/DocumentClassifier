Elon Musk gave nearly $75M to pro-Trump super PAC in Q3
Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, gave nearly $75 million to the pro-Trump super PAC that he helped form over the summer, new filings with the Federal Election Commission show, providing a massive infusion of cash to support the former president’s White House bid.

The new filing from the super PAC, America PAC, detailed seven separate contributions from Musk that totaled $74,950,000 between July and September. They’re the first contributions that Musk has made to the group, which received its initial funding from a network of the billionaire’s former partners and business associates.

According to the group’s filing, America PAC spent nearly $72 million in the quarter, entering October with about $4 million in cash on hand.

America PAC has taken on a critical supporting role for the Trump campaign, according to its independent expenditure filings, which cover some spending activity past the end of the third quarter period. To date, America PAC has now reported spending $95.8 million on the presidential race, including $56.9 million on canvassing and field operations. The group has also spent millions targeting a series of highly competitive House races, including key buckets of contests in California and New York.

Musk is one of several ultra wealthy donors who cut massive checks to pro-Trump organizations in the third quarter as the presidential race intensified. Miriam Adelson, widow of the late casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, gave $95 million to another leading pro-Trump super PAC, Preserve America, while Midwestern shipping magnate Dick Uihlein gave nearly $50 million to another group, Restoration PAC, adding to the pro-Trump outside effort.
