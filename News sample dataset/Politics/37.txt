Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said Tuesday that mothers are “the best ambassadors” to convince women to vote for the GOP ticket, acknowledging the gender gap in the 2024 race that has seen Donald Trump leading among men and Kamala Harris leading among women.

“I see the polls, the polls tell you – and I don’t necessarily believe the polls – but you know, let’s say they’re right. If the polls are right, right now, frankly, Trump would win this election, and that’s a good thing,” the Ohio senator said at a Moms for America town hall in Pennsylvania. “The polls also tell you that we’re doing better – President Trump and I are doing better with male voters, and the Democrats are doing a little bit better with female voters.”

“I think moms are the best ambassadors to say, ‘Look, don’t believe the lies that you’ve heard about these guys. Vote for what’s in your best interest. Vote for public safety. Vote for lower grocery prices for your family. Vote for housing prices that are affordable for more people to live in American homes,’” Vance added.


A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll found a 17-point gender gap in the presidential race, with Trump winning male voters by 8 points and Harris leading among women by 9 points. The latest CNN Poll of Polls average of national polling still finds no clear leader in the presidential race, with an average of 50% of likely voters supporting Harris and 47% backing Trump.

Moms for America leaders said they also invited Vance’s Democratic counterpart, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, to attend the town hall, but they said he didn’t respond. Walz had three events in Pennsylvania on Tuesday – in Lawrence County, Butler County and Pittsburgh.
