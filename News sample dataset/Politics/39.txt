Bernie Sanders says Trump "working overtime" to undermine democracy
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that Donald Trump is “working overtime” to undermine democracy, with the independent senator also highlighting the broad coalition opposing the former president.

Sanders, a progressive who caucuses with Senate emocrats, was asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” whether Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power worries him.

“It makes me wonder why anyone, no matter what your political views may be — you’re conservative, you’re moderate, you’re progressive — we cannot support somebody who is working overtime to undermine American democracy, who fomented an insurrection. I was there and trust me, it was a violent insurrection,” Sanders said.

Sanders, who has at times criticized Vice President Kamala Harris and the Biden administration, highlighted the importance of this election despite policy differences. He highlighted Republicans who now are not supporting Trump, including Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and former Vice President Dick Cheney, who said last month he is voting for Harris.

“They understand that because of his lack of support for democracy. Because of the fact that he’s a pathological liar. This is a guy who is not fit to be president of the United States,” Sanders said.

Asked by Collins what he makes of CNN reporting that Trump plans to visit a McDonald’s on Sunday in Pennsylvania and work the fry cooker after claiming without evidence that Harris lied about once working at the fast food chain, Sanders laughed.

“Well, look, I smile and laugh whenever Donald Trump, of all people, accuses somebody of lying. You know, what can you say? This guy lies every single day,” the senator said.
