Trump calls himself the “father of IVF” at Fox News town hall focused on women’s issues
Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday called himself the “father of IVF” at a Fox News town hall focused on women’s issues.

“I’m the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question,” Trump said at the town hall taped in the critical battleground state of Georgia after Fox News host Harris Faulkner indicated the next question would be about IVF.

Trump said, “We really are the party for IVF. We want fertilization, and it’s all the way, and the Democrats tried to attack us on it, and we’re out there on IVF, even more than them. So, we’re totally in favor,” Trump said at the town hall, which was taped in Cumming, Georgia.

The former president pointed to his statement earlier this year urging the Alabama state legislature to protect access to IVF after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled frozen embryos are children and that those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. The GOP-controlled state legislature later passed a law aimed at protecting IVF patients and providers from legal liability and it was signed by the state’s Republican governor.

Trump’s declaration he is the “father of IVF” comes as Vice President Kamala Harris and other leading Democrats warn a Trump victory in November would threaten reproductive rights, including IVF.

Republicans who expressed support for IVF in the wake of the controversial Alabama Supreme Court ruling came under scrutiny for also backing legislation that declared human life as beginning at conception, which did not include an exception for IVF.
