While exiting a restaurant, Lively, Reynolds, Swift and Kelce were bombarded by fans, who waited outside to catch a glimpse of the celebrity couples together.

As they made their way outside, both couples were seen holding hands as they started walking towards their vehicle.


In a video that a fan shared on X, someone in the crowd yelled, "Go Chiefs!" and Kelce appeared to respond with a nod and a smile.

Lively and Reynolds have joined Swift at a Chiefs game before. The couple attended the Chiefs-Jets matchup in New Jersey Oct. 1, 2023. Lively also went to the Super Bowl earlier this year with Swift and cheered on the Chiefs to victory over the San Francisco 49ers.

Swift and Lively previously hung out together in New York in December 2023 when they were spotted celebrating Swift's 34th birthday together on the Lower East Side in New York.

For that occasion, Swift wore a black mini-dress with platform heels by Aquazzura and an Anine Bing Hilary jacket in black faux fur.

Lively twinned with her friend and also wore black. The "It Ends With Us" star donned a Michael Kors Collection dress with black knee-high boots.
