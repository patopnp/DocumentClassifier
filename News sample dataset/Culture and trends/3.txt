There is perhaps no designer more entranced by the boggy quagmire of time than Ghesquière, who has, over his decade-plus tenure at the helm of womenswear, produced an oeuvre that constantly doubles back on itself to emerge anew, plumbing not only his own past creative efforts but the depths of Vuitton’s history to work and rework concepts of self-presentation. At a moment when many major fashion houses have been undergoing changes to their creative direction—Gucci, Valentino, Chanel, Chloé, Alexander McQueen, and Givenchy, to name just a few—Ghesquière’s lengthy term is all the more significant.

He arrived at Vuitton labeled a futurist, “but, you know, the future is now for me,” he told Ingrid Sischy in a 2014 interview for this magazine, his first after he was announced for the role. Six years later, when I spoke to him for a mid-pandemic profile, he told me that he had become increasingly interested in history—no surprise, maybe, when at Vuitton he’s so steeped in it. “My inspiration has been extended,” he said, “because I’m okay to explore past, present, and future.”

Este, Danielle, and Alana Haim—the trio of 30-something sisters who are the rock band Haim, known for their intimate, ebullient love songs and music videos often directed by Paul Thomas Anderson in which they stride through the streets of Los Angeles—have been following Ghesquière’s trajectory since they were teens in the Valley, rifling through magazines and tearing out Balenciaga ads; they released their first album a little more than a month before Ghesquière joined Vuitton. On a four-way video call, the sisters beaming in from their respective sun-soaked LA homes, Este calls Ghesquière “an oracle.” Danielle describes his aesthetic as “lived-in, but structured and cool.” When I mention that the descriptor isn’t a bad fit for Haim’s folky, exuberantly danceable sound, she continues, “We’ve always just been such fans—with clothing, with music—of taking so much inspiration from the past but hopefully making something that looks new again.”
