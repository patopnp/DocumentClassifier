Rebel Wilson announces marriage to Ramona Agruma
The "Pitch Perfect" star announced the news with a photo from the Italian island of Sardinia.

Actor Rebel Wilson announced her marriage to Ramona Agruma in an Instagram post Monday. 

Wilson, 44, and Agruma, 40, were pictured in white gowns, holding hands and flower bouquets. Wilson announced her surprise Disneyland engagement to Agruma, an entrepreneur, in February 2023. 

According to the post, the two wed Saturday on the Italian island of Sardinia.

In June 2022, the “Pitch Perfect” star announced in an Instagram post that she was in a relationship with a woman. In the post, uploaded during LGBTQ Pride Month, she wrote, “I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess.” 

A few months later, Wilson announced the birth of her first child, a baby girl born via surrogate.

“Beyond proud to announce the birth of my first child, Royce Lillian, born this past week via surrogate. I can’t even describe the love I have for her, she’s a beautiful miracle!” Wilson wrote on social media.

While Wilson has not confirmed how she identifies, she told People magazine in a February 2023 interview promoting her dating app Fluid that “I know that, to me, it doesn’t matter about the gender, it just matters about the person.”
